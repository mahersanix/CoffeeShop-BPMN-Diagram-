The process I choose was the purchase of coffee at Amazon.
The actors in this scenario are the customer, the cashier and the barista. 
The process starts when the customer walks in an order a  coffee or beverage, then the cashier  takes the order and inputs the information into the computer. 
Next the cashier confirms the order with the customer and the buyer pays for the purchase. 
After the payment has been received the cashier needs to decided whether he or she will be able to accomplish this task by herself or the task has to be delegated to the barista. 
the decisions stage are represented with the shape of a diamond and two swimlanes tell us of the possible outcome. 
if she decides that she or he can fulfill the order then they can deliver the order, if not then he or she has to delegated the task to a second person who is the barista. 
The barista prepares the order and delivers the coffee to the customer. The final process is when the customer gets the coffee and walks out the door with its coffee in their hand.
